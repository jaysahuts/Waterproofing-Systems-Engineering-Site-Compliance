## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS REPOSITORY
This repository is a practical engineering reference for waterproofing systems
used in residential and high-rise buildings.

It integrates:
- External above-ground waterproofing (AS 4654.2)
- Internal domestic wet area waterproofing (AS 3740)
- Wet area membrane material performance (AS/NZS 4858)

This document translates Standards into:
- Design intent understanding
- Site inspection checkpoints
- Trade coordination guidance
- Defect and litigation risk reduction

This is NOT a reproduction of any Standard.
It is an engineer’s applied guide for construction projects.

## 2. WHY WATERPROOFING IS HIGH RISK
Waterproofing failures typically result in:
- Water ingress
- Structural deterioration
- Mould and health issues
- Costly rectification
- Builder and engineer liability

Most failures are caused by:
- Poor detailing
- Incorrect installation
- Poor supervision
- Lack of understanding of Standards
- Interface failures between trades

---

- Compatibility with AS 3740 systems

---

## 4. WATERPROOFING SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY
Waterproofing is a SYSTEM, not a product.

A compliant system includes:
- Suitable substrate
- Compatible membrane
- Correct detailing
- Proper terminations
- Drainage and falls
- Protection layers
- Quality finishes

Failure of any component = system failure.

---

## 5. EXTERNAL WATERPROOFING – AS 4654.2

### Typical Applications
- Balconies over habitable spaces
- Podium slabs
- Roof decks
- External corridors
- Planter boxes

### Exposure Conditions
- UV exposure
- Thermal movement
- Rain and wind
- Maintenance traffic
- Structural movement

---

## 6. EXTERNAL SUBSTRATES
Substrates must be:
- Structurally sound
- Smooth and clean
- Free of laitance
- Correctly cured
- Properly graded for falls

Common substrates:
- Concrete slabs
- Screeds
- Masonry

Site Engineer Checks:
- Moisture content suitable
- No cracking beyond membrane capacity
- No ponding areas
- Correct falls achieved

---

## 7. FALLS AND DRAINAGE (CRITICAL)
Poor falls are a major cause of failure.

Principles:
- Water must drain, not pond
- Falls formed in structure or screed
- Membrane must follow falls
- Drain locations coordinated early

Typical issues:
- Insufficient falls
- Level thresholds
- Blocked outlets
- Poor detailing at drains

---

## 8. MEMBRANE TYPES (EXTERNAL)
Common membrane systems:
- Liquid-applied membranes
- Fully bonded sheet membranes
- Torch-applied membranes

Key considerations:
- UV resistance
- Movement accommodation
- Compatibility with finishes
- Maintenance access

---

## 9. JOINTS, FILLETING AND MOVEMENT
Movement occurs due to:
- Thermal expansion
- Shrinkage
- Structural deflection

Requirements:
- Fillets at changes of plane
- Movement joints honoured through membrane
- Flexible detailing at penetrations

Ignoring movement leads to cracking and leaks.

---

## 10. MEMBRANE TERMINATIONS (HIGH-RISK DETAIL)
Critical termination areas:
- Upturns at walls
- Door thresholds
- Balustrade posts
- Parapets
- Drain outlets

Key principles:
- Adequate upturn height
- Mechanical fixing where required
- Compatible flashing
- No reliance on sealant alone

---

## 11. PROTECTION OF EXTERNAL MEMBRANES
Membranes must be protected from:
- Mechanical damage
- UV degradation
- Trades during construction

Protection methods:
- Toppings
- Pavers
- Screeds
- Protection boards

Unprotected membranes are a defect risk.

---

## 12. INTERNAL WET AREAS – AS 3740

### Wet Area Classification
Areas include:
- Shower areas
- Bathroom floors
- Walls subject to water splash
- Junctions around fixtures

Correct classification defines:
- Extent of waterproofing
- Height of wall membranes
- Drainage requirements

---

## 13. EXTENT OF INTERNAL WATERPROOFING
Waterproofing must extend:
- Across entire shower area
- Up walls to required heights
- Around penetrations
- At junctions and corners

Common failures:
- Incomplete wall coverage
- Missed junctions
- Poor detailing behind fixtures

---

## 14. FALLS IN WET AREAS
Falls are mandatory in:
- Shower floors
- Bathroom floors where required

Principles:
- Water must drain to waste
- No ponding
- No water migration outside wet area

Poor falls lead to:
- Persistent moisture
- Tile debonding
- Mould growth

---

## 15. DRAINS AND WASTES
Drain detailing is critical.

Requirements:
- Compatible flange
- Membrane bonded to flange
- No gaps or cuts
- Adequate drainage path

Most wet area leaks occur at the floor waste.

---

## 16. WALL AND FLOOR JUNCTIONS
Junctions include:
- Wall to floor
- Wall to wall
- Around penetrations

Requirements:
- Bond breakers where required
- Flexible membrane continuity
- No rigid restraint

Cracking usually initiates at junctions.

---

## 17. WET AREA MEMBRANE MATERIALS – AS/NZS 4858

### Purpose of AS/NZS 4858
Defines performance requirements for membranes used in wet areas.

It does NOT define installation.
It defines material suitability.

---

## 18. MEMBRANE CLASSIFICATION
Membranes are classified by:
- Elongation capacity
- Movement accommodation
- Durability

Higher movement capacity = better crack resistance.

Site Risk:
- Using membranes unsuitable for expected movement

---

## 19. DURABILITY AND PERFORMANCE
Membranes must resist:
- Water immersion
- Heat ageing
- Chemical exposure
- Cyclic movement

Inferior membranes fail prematurely even if installed correctly.

---

## 20. COMPATIBILITY OF MATERIALS
All components must be compatible:
- Primer
- Membrane
- Adhesives
- Sealants
- Tiles and finishes

Mixing systems from different manufacturers is high risk.

---

## 21. INSTALLATION QUALITY CONTROL
Critical inspection stages:
- Substrate preparation
- Membrane application
- Junction detailing
- Drain treatment
- Protection installation
- Pre-cover inspection

If you cannot see it, you cannot verify it.

---

## 22. COMMON SITE NON-COMPLIANCES
- No falls or inadequate falls
- Poor membrane terminations
- Missed penetrations
- Incompatible materials
- Membrane damage by other trades
- No inspection records

---

## 23. DEFECTS AND LITIGATION RISK
Waterproofing defects:
- Are slow to appear
- Are expensive to fix
- Often require demolition
- Frequently end in disputes

Most claims argue:
- Non-compliance with Standards
- Poor workmanship
- Inadequate supervision

---

## 24. PRACTICAL ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES
- Waterproofing must be designed, not improvised
- Trades must be supervised
- Interfaces matter more than flat areas
- Documentation protects the engineer
- Early inspections save massive rework

---

## 25. ENGINEER’S LEARNING LOG
Record:
- Waterproofing failures observed
- Consultant feedback
- Defect root causes
- Lessons learned
- Improvements for future projects
